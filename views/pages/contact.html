  <h2>A night at The Crown</h2>
  <p>
    Comedy In The Crown is free to attend. For the moment you don't even need to register for tickets.
    Simply arrive with plenty of time to get a drink from the bar and find a seat ready for the night to begin at 8pm.
    Gig nights are every Tuesday, but we do break for a short rest over the summer so keep an eye on the <a href="/dates">dates page</a> to find the best night to visit us.

    We welcome seasoned performers and curious first-timers alike. We have a lot of demand for our 7 minute spots, so the more flexible you can be about when in the future you'd like to perform, the easier it will be to grab your moment.

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.crownstalbans.com/">The Crown</a> is a lovely pub in St Albans. Just 20 minutes from St Pancras station, we have a little more elbow room than you often find in London. The Crown also has excellent food and a cosy beer garden.
